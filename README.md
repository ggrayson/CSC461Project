# CSC461Project
Research project on the hardware &amp; software techniques used to implement camera arrays in newer model smartphones

I've decided to host the research part of my project in a "living document" on google docs. This document will be updated as I research new topics and will eventually be converted into the final report.

# Midterm Update:

**– on the progresses with regard to the schedule**

I've covered all the necessary background information and now I'm doing research into camera arrays, image sensors and image synthesis (called multi-frame photography). I've gathered a lot of interesting articles & research papers. I was late getting started because of the Midterm Exam and other classes but now that I've started I feel like I'm making good progress. I've written about 3 pages of the report and I feel like I'll be able to get to 10 or more easily.

**– technical challenges met, solved and remaining**

The main problem I've had is making the jump from consumer electronics to academic research. It's hard to cut through the corporate branding and find out what area of research underlies the advances in camera technology that the smartphone makers are advertising. For example, the Huawei P30 has something Huawei calls a "SuperSpectrum sensor". Figuring out the academic name for that branded technology and finding research papers related to it can be difficult.

One thing I've found useful for this is referencing articles from sites like Android Authority and DXOMark, which are more in-depth than typical popular technology blogs. These serve as a good middle ground between consumer-focused articles and proper academic papers, and searching for keywords found on these sites has been useful for bringing up the academic research. For example I learned that combining images from multiple cameras is called "multi-frame" and searching for that on Google Scholar brought up a lot of the research I was interested in.

**– additional help needed if any**

If any of the other groups working with cameras or image sensors find anything cool related to smartphones, please pass them my way.

**– adjustment requested to the proposal**

I want to broaden my topic to be more generally about advances in smartphone image sensors & software. What I found during my research is that the physical components of smarphone cameras like lenses, apertures etc are pretty much a "solved" problem and that the real advances are in the image sensors and associated software. Camera arrays are one major advancement in camera phone techology, but since image sensors are an incredibly broad topic that encompasses pretty much all of digital photography, there are other things I'd like to talk about too.

**– anything else needs to be updated**

I'm not sure what I will do for a demo, I might try out some android app development to showcase the difference between the multiple cameras installed in a device if it doesn't look too difficult.
